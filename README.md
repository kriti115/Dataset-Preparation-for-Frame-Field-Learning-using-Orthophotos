# Evaluation-of-Frame-Field-Learning-for-Orthophotos
An evaluation of the frame field learning technique for extraction of building polygons in vector format from true orthophotos.

This is the code for preparation of dataset from scratch for running a network using the Frame Field Learning technique.

The steps can be described as shown in the figure below:
